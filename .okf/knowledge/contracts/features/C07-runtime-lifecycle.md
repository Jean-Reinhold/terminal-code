# Contract

Prefer verified vendored/offline artifacts, preserve target triples and platform binary layout, reject size/SHA mismatch before unpack, coordinate one boot, validate PID/ports/version/readiness, warm the injector, persist canonical server state, and stop only the managed process.

# Coverage Status

Current tests cover injector readiness rather than the full lifecycle. H3 requires local artifact peers and harness-owned process scenarios for stale state, crashes, timeouts, offline resolution, and cleanup.
